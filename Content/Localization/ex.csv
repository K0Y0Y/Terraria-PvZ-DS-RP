Key,Translation"Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Guide","A projection of the First Terrarian.  He will do his best to assist you on your quest, in ways you might not have expected... or wanted.  Though his power is nearly immeasurable, he will reign it in as it's not his place to employ it... yet.  The Guide is the one who granted many powerful abilities to humankind and transformed most of them into the Terrarians we know today.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Merchant","An elderly Lesser Terrarian hailing directly from the Continent. Merchants often immigrate to the Archipelago in order to supply Greater Terrarians who wish to begin a colony there... and, of course, profit from it!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Nurse","The technological and magical advancements of the Terrarian race have allowed medical practices to be far more effortless than ever before!  For the Lesser variety, a simple injection of a modified Healing Potion will do. For the Greater variety, unfortunately, something pricier is required.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Demolitionist","When the Guide first gifted his powers to humankind, a clan of humans of smaller stature spurned them and instead took shelter in the caves beneath the Continent.  These humans became the Dwarves over time.  To this day, they can't get enough of explosives and the precious minerals they pave the way towards!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Angler","When the nightly undead raids of the Archipelago become too much for a settlement to handle, it often instigates a full evacuation to the Continent.  On rare occasions, some children can be forgotten in the panic.  These unfortunate few must learn to survive on their own somehow... and fishing is both a very efficient and easily sustainable way to do so.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Dryad","The immortal Dryads were given the Powers of Purity by the Derplings long ago.  They can instantly assess the amount of Corrupt/Crimtane Infection in an area large enough to encompass an entire island in the Archipelago, allowing them to determine the best course of action to take against it and even purify some of it themselves. This made them incredibly efficient scouts during the War Against Darkness.  Unlike Terrarians, who can simply resurrect themselves on defeat, the Dryads reincarnate as a sapling in the Sacred Grove on the Continent before they can manifest their humanoid form once again, retaining all memories of their previous life.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ArmsDealer","When the Derplings created high velocity metallic projectile weapons, they had no idea how quickly the concept would gain popularity among the Terrarians for purposes such as self defense against hostile creatures such as the undead.  For some, trading and creating new twists on this concept has become a lifelong passion!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DyeTrader","Color composition is a precise and refined art for this Terrarian.  He particularly enjoys when the Greater Terrarians create their attire from a mixture of dyes and even multiple costumes or armor sets, as opposed to using only one color or matching set of clothing.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Painter","In some islands of the Archipelago, it's customary to bring painters gifts of Sauteed Frog Legs in large amounts with no particular patterns.  It's not known why or how the Terrarians came up with this, but your resident painter will likely repay you in large amounts if you partake!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Stylist","With the proper dye, even your hair can become a tool.  At least, that's the main selling point.  The Derplings shared their knowledge of chemicals with Terrarian hair stylists so that they could create colors that change dynamically and can be used to relay information to the user.  There's even one which reacts to the positions of the sun and moon and changes color accordingly, and it even works underground! You would think that someone with unlimited access to these tools wouldn't have gotten lost exploring a cave...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BestiaryGirl","Rogue Lycanthropes often study and categorize their findings on many of the creatures found in the Archipelago.  Most of them resort to asking the Derplings for help on some of the life forms that are more difficult to study, in return for misinforming many of the terrarians for security purposes.  The fact that you're reading this means you're lucky enough to be deemed an exception!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2Bartender","A visitor from another world, free from the influence of the Primordials.  While many universes intersect with the Terrarian Plane, the one the Tavernkeep is native to does so in a completely perpendicular fashion, meaning the ejected flotsam is less chaotic and more systematic in nature.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Golfer","A member of a strange desert-residing order which searches for a mysterious artifact known as the First Sphere.  It is said to cure many ailments of magical nature, including ones such as Lycanthropy.  Their equipment is intended for long distance sight and scouting, but can also be used in a relaxing game!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinTinkerer","This goblin has a much lower concentration of Shadowflame in his system than others, allowing him to be much more intelligent!  Unfortunately he was viewed as dangerous by his own kin as a result.  Tries his best at reforging and upgrading your gear, but he's frankly terrible at it, specializing in more convenience-oriented inventions.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_WitchDoctor","The Lihzahrds seem to despise and fear magic due to some ancient memory, causing them to cast this one out of their temple for merely taking an interest in it.  Unlike most who practice magic, the Witch Doctors focus on collaborating with more Primordial influences... whatever that means.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Mechanic","Traveled to the Archipelago in order to research some of the mysterious advanced structures there, and even managed to hack through the first layer of security into one herself!  Unfortunately she was restrained by the second layer soon after.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Clothier","Once served as a vessel for the Dungeon's security system in order to keep it (and himself) safe from the Necroavirus. Eventually the virus was exterminated, but he could not separate from the system without a... catalyst.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Wizard","The more elderly and eccentric residents of the Magistic Academy on the Continent often teleport to islands in the Archipelago where an explosion of magic has been recently detected. They usually get parts of the spell incorrect, however...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Steampunker","A soldier who wields many devices of Derptech origin.  Steampunkers were originally created to serve as cleansing soldiers in the War Against Darkness, but more recently they simply supply Greater Terrarians with the necessary equipment to cleanse infections themself.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Pirate","Some members of the Terrarian Race became restless and separated from the gargantuan colonies located on the Continent. They instead opted for the lawless lands of the ocean and Archipelago, a few choosing to settle down in the colonies of Greater Terrarians who have proven their worth.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Truffle","The Mycelium. A gift to fight infection, rejuvenate those in need, throw light into the darkest of caverns.  That's what the Truffle says it is, anyway.  It doesn't seem very interested in elaborating besides the fact that each individual branch of Mycelium is actually all one organism. Meaning if you walk on the ‘grass' located there, you're actually walking on the resident truffle's skin in a sort of way.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TaxCollector","Attempting to extort the Demons of the Underworld was a gargantuan lapse in judgment on this man's part, to say the least.  When a man has reached such a point of desperation that his only remaining option is to extort beasts that know naught but a grand cavern resembling that of hell itself, he probably is going to take every chance he can get to settle down somewhere.  No matter how useless you think he is, you likely won't get him to stay away for long.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Cyborg","PRIMORDIAL SCOUT HAS BEEN COMPROMISED. ARRANGE THE ARRIVAL OF A BACKUP SCOUT. WE MUST ASSIST THE TERRARIAN AND ENSURE SAFETY FROM FUTURE THREATS. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PartyGirl","No one is quite sure about the origins of this individual.  Their wares are probably more useful than you might think, though.  Some theorize that she's a manifestation of a creature from another dimension just here to enjoy herself. Others theorize she's the manifestation of a Higher Being known as the Harmony Huntress.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Princess","The aristocracy of the Continent only allow their children to travel to the Archipelago as a learning experience/prolonged field trip.  They tend to make sure that the colony they would be residing in is substantially large and safe enough for them first, though.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SantaClaus","The elves were a lie.  He actually gains his gifts for others by slaughtering any hostile Archipelago creature that enters his presence and reshaping their parts.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownCat","Unlike most friendly creatures, Town Pets aren't terribly picky when it comes to the location they reside in. Additionally, they boost the morale of nearby Lesser Terrarians without causing them to feel crowded.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownDog"," The Pet Delivery Services on the Continent are so overcrowded that they're willing to give away their pets for free! Unfortunately, the same can't be said about those who sell licenses to own one in a place as dangerous as the Archipelago.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownBunny","A precious sign of hope in the Archipelago. Essentially a mascot for the Purity. Naturally, owning one requires a significant understanding of the Archipelago's creatures and dangers as a prerequisite.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeBlue","After assessment of a budding Greater Terrarians' abilities is complete, there is still a lot of work to be done.  The Nerdy Slime does this by shedding much of its mass from its King Slime form and inserting itself into Terrarian society.  Through doing this, it may monitor the Greater Terrarian and gather data on them and Lesser Terrarians alike.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeGreen","The Cool Slime was assigned to enter a Terrarian Colony by any means necessary.  So naturally, if it were to enter during a celebration where a ton of people are gathered in one place, it wouldn't be noticed. Right?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeOld","The very first slime to enter development by the Derplings, who gave it the first neuron lattice capable of feeling emotion and expressing a personality later on.  Unfortunately, it does not contain any scouting systems, which means that unlike the younger slimes, it is unable to relay information to the Derplings and is unemployed as a result.  It was originally locked away with the other Derpling experiments in the Dungeon, but somehow its containment vessel breached the security there and has been wandering the Archipelago.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimePurple","An aerial variant of slime, created in honor of a late Higher Being.  Its fragile mode of transportation coupled with an ambitious mission necessitated a personality matrix be included in this design.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeRainbow","Somehow, the dimensional refuse left by intersecting planes transported a slime idol from its celebrity home in the Derpling Motherplanes.  It seems perfectly content with its new audience, though!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeRed","Blood Moons bridge the gap to pocket dimensions within water, where unspeakable horrors make their home.  Naturally the Derplings have taken a great interest in these places, so a scout was sent there.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeYellow","A more experimental model of the jungle scout,  which is able to polymorph itself into several forms.  A few kinks have yet to be worked out, however.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TownSlimeCopper","A scout which has been compromised due to Terrarian interference. Fortunately it can still conduct surveillance on their colonies. The usage of weaponry is not part of its programming, meaning it's unable to use its blade.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TravellingMerchant","One of the few travelers who has visited both the Continent and the Archipelago, alongside several places which are only theorized about.  It's unknown whether he actually created some of his more exotic wares or purchased them from places on his travels.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SkeletonMerchant","!!ATTENTION!! If you find one of these, restrain it and contact your nearest Derpling outpost immediately.  They are extremely elusive and are highly suspected of being able to reverse the effects of the Necroavirus, meaning that if one is captured, then we have a decent chance of bringing back the Furred Dragons.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_OldMan","Security protocol prevents disclosure of this Terrarian's bestiary entry at this time.  To gain proper credentials, complete the related assessment.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BoundTownSlimeYellow","Polymorphing is a rather impure art.  Thankfully this frog seems to have been expertly transformed, though.  I wonder if a slime could be polymorphed by contact with specific metals....""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Bunny","An icon of absolute purity, highly prized on the continent due to their abilities to weakly inhibit magical wards.  These creatures are highly endangered outside of the Archipelago, and trafficking them is highly illegal.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PartyBunny","The Party Girl can be quite sneaky when she wants to be.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ExplosiveBunny","The ward inhibiting powers of the bunny combined with powerful explosives made for a weapon so devastating that most creatures evolved to specifically resist it to a certain extent.  Unfortunately for them, it's still quite strong.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BunnySlimed","The mind control casing on this bunny allows them to serve as temporary scouts for the Derplings. Fortunately, if the bunny dislikes it they can remove it on their own.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BunnyXmas","This horrifying hat fills these bunnies with an infinite rage while not under Terrarian supervision, causing them to extract monster parts for Santa's Toys.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.GoldCritter","A feeble voice beckons within the minds of the weak.  It promises protection, it promises everything.  Most spurn it, as they wisely should. But for those infinitesimal few who indulge it,  free will is naught but a memory.  Their senses torn asunder, their own gleam is all they see.  They cannot recall anything but the Hoard they have entered.  Some allow this horrid entity to gain full control, and by doing so, their fate worsens further.  They regain the sight they formerly had, and are horrified by the dull world they must now gaze upon.  Their voice is silenced by gleaming metal... and they must scream.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Bird","These creatures are descended from the Harmony's infected, and are able to continue said lineage themselves.  If you're not careful, you can still get hypnotized by their songs...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BirdBlue","This species of bird was created as a scout for the Derplings, but unfortunately they were unable to handle the surveying equipment. They continued to breed on their own, and the Derplings looked to more... gelatinous means of spying.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BirdRed","This rare bird exists as a result of a mutation from a Blue Jay.  Their biology is more adapted to snowy climates, but for whatever reason they choose not to make their homes there. Perhaps this is why they aren't as common?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ScarletMacaw","After a certain prophecy mentioned that a bird could end the world, Macaws and their mimicry were placed under scrutiny.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BlueMacaw","The Derpling's fear of these creatures is not entirely baseless. In fact, they have a bit of a prior history in another world...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Toucan","A rather amusing bird, the product of one of  many Derpling experiments.  Unlike most other animals, these creatures reproduce through mitosis.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_YellowCockatiel","These loud birds are very scary to Derplings, who once witnessed them do something terrible.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GrayCockatiel","For whatever reason, this species of jungle bird seems to be the only one that Derplings aren't afraid of.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Goldfish","According to all known laws of locomotion, there is no way a goldfish should be able to walk.  Its fins are far too small to get its fat little body over the ground. The goldfish, of course, walks anyway.  Because goldfish don't care what Terrarians think is impossible.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Squirrel","Despite being most commonly sighted on land, these creatures originated from extensive underwater cities located in the deepest parts of Terraria's oceans.  It seems that they are attempting to send ambassadors to communicate with the Terrarians, but they unfortunately do not share any languages with any bipedal race.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SquirrelRed","Red Squirrel: The birth of a Red Squirrel is regarded as a bad omen in Squirrel Society.  A rather unsettling fact, considering they have been growing more and more common in recent years...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Mouse","A delicate creature which is unsettled by Terrarians and as a result is a rare sight around their settlements.  Their ability to phase through stone is a rather curious one, as necessary as it may be in the Caverns. Oddly enough, their Continent cousins don't seem to fear Terrarians at all and are even considered a pest there.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Frog","Their high nutritional value and calorie count makes them a popular delicacy in Derpling society.  Additionally, they are often used by Derpling Cultivators deep in the jungle to tell time, as they only croak at night, even when the sky isn't visible.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Grasshopper","The Great Insect War was long ago, but the Grasshoppers will never forget the sacrifices of their brethren to the Ant Armies.  Not related to Derplings.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.GoldBaitCritter","A feeble voice beckons within the minds of the weak.  It promises protection, it promises everything.  Most spurn it, as they wisely should. But for those infinitesimal few who indulge it,  free will is naught but a memory.  Their senses torn asunder, their own gleam is all they see.  They cannot recall anything but the Hoard they have entered.  Some allow this horrid entity to gain full control, and by doing so, their fate worsens further.  They regain the sight they formerly had, and are horrified by the dull world they must now gaze upon.  Their voice is silenced by gleaming metal... and they must scream.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Butterfly","An experiment created by a certain bug-loving Derpling, these creatures come in several varieties with different traits.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Worm","An incredibly dangerous species, albeit in a harmless larval form.  Do not underestimate them.  Allowing them to grow to a mature state is a rare but dangerous mistake.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Dragonfly","Not actually associated with dragons, but the fact that it's found in very diverse climates is interesting nonetheless.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Seahorse","Not related to horses.  Their excrement can collect in deposits often confused for shells. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_WaterStrider","These creatures were used as aquatic mounts during the Great Insect War.  Rumor has it that if you listen closely, you can still hear a story from one of these about said war.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_LadyBug","A beetle blessed by the Higher Beings.  Rumor has it that the Fickle Flame himself will smile upon you for treating these well.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Stinkbug","A beetle cursed by the Higher Beings. Followers of the Fickle Flame are repulsed by their scent, and as a result they can be used to repel them.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Shimmerfly","Weaker beings that fall into Shimmer have their biologies scrambled into something unique.  No two Faelings are quite alike when dissected.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Duck","This species of duck is entirely male.  Thankfully, they are able to breed with their white counterparts.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DuckWhite","Long ago, Ducks had magical powers so gargantuan that they were able to seal any being for eternity.  Unfortunately, this angered the Higher Beings, who swiftly stripped this power away.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Turtle","Surprisingly, these creatures are able to challenge bunnies to races and win.  You'd think this would be exclusive to tortoises.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Owl","These creatures are incredibly close to the Higher Beings.  So close, in fact, that a lucky few have heard their voices through their hoots.  As a result, they are considered sacred by the followers of the Fickle Flame and cooking them has been outlawed.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Firefly","A spy for the Hallow, sent to monitor the state of the Purity while it's sealed.  Their sac can store light and emit it later, but it's very faint due to the lack of ambient light energy in the Forest.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EnchantedNightcrawler","Sometimes, when a fallen star lands on a worm, it becomes imbued with its power.  These creatures are immortal, but can be killed.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FairyCritterPink","An infant child of the Empress of Light, sent to assist the Terrarian in gaining power.  Unlike their more mature state, these creatures cannot change the color of their glow.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FairyCritterGreen","An infant child of the Empress of Light, sent to assist the Terrarian in gaining power.  Unlike their more mature state, these creatures cannot change the color of their glow.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FairyCritterBlue","An infant child of the Empress of Light, sent to assist the Terrarian in gaining power.  Unlike their more mature state, these creatures cannot change the color of their glow.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Rat","This critter is actually incredibly common, but most attracted to Ecto Mist.  They only work up the courage to appear once they can get a whiff of it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Maggot","The scent of death draws out these larval creatures, unfortunately they are so in tune with death that they die upon finishing their pupal stage rather than progressing into a more mature form.  No one really knows what an adult Maggot looks like, which makes many wonder how they breed.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.GemSquirrel","A construct, created by dwarves to search for its respective gem. ""CommonBestiaryFlavor.GemBunny","These bunnies are meticulously crafted from a single gem and animated with magic, rather than being alive.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Snail","These creatures feed on trash and refuse from the old Human colonies. Sometimes, you can even find them within stuff that's been thrown away and extract them from it!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TruffleWorm","The Mycelium was actually based on these worms.  It was a creation of the Duke himself, who designed it after his favorite snack.  These worms are long extinct in their oceanic habitats, but thankfully the Duke's new home for them allows them to thrive.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Penguin","These creatures are completely incapable of swimming, despite their bone structure stating otherwise.  In addition, they are one of the most easily available foods to mass-produce due to their extremely fertile nature.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Scorpion","Despite their pale color, these scorpions are actually not at all poisonous.  It's unknown why the Archipelago variant of these scorpions are this way.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ScorpionBlack","An infant Sand Poacher.  Weirdly, their dark coloration does correspond to their lack of poison, but they lose this logic as they grow up.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Grebe","Not at all related to ducks, despite what cooking them would have you believe.  How a Greater Terrarian can create a duck from something that is clearly not a duck is a mystery.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Pupfish","A rather adorable fish, known for its unparalleled innocence. This reputation came from the fact that the pools they are found in are some of the smallest on the planet.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Seagull","Despised by Derplings due to their common behavior of stealing their supply of grapes.  Fortunately, they rarely enter the same territory that Derplings reside in. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SeaTurtle","These creatures are actually quite a pest in the ruins of the Derpling Motherbase, but they are far more docile in the Archipelago.  Perhaps the synthetic structure there has angered these critters.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Dolphin","Pirates often confuse these creatures for Mermaids.  What a silly delusion, mermaids don't exist!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TurtleJungle","The Derpling responsible for creating the butterflies used to be such an effective Jungle Turtle collector that the mere sight of a derpling is enough to send them into a fear-filled frenzy.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Grubby","The infant form of Buggy.  Despite their succulent flavor, they are actually not very popular among fish. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Sluggy","The juvenile form of Buggy.  It's highly unusual for a juvenile stage of an insect to take on a sluglike biology, but somehow the Sluggy manages.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Buggy","The adult form of Grubby.  After a long and arduous journey, it's finally progressed to the adult stage.  Please don't eat it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_HellButterfly","The Derpling who created the other butterflies wished to challenge herself, so she tried to create one that could survive the fires of the Underworld.  It worked quite well!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Lavafly","Rather than storing light in their sac, Lavaflies store lava within them and purify it.  Unfortunately, purified lava doesn't actually serve any uses that lava doesn't, so there's no point in trying to extract it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MagmaSnail","The lava Magma Snails drink is secreted into a sticky variant that makes many surfaces too hot to touch.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_LightningBug","A bug which flourishes in the Hallow.  Their light sac is inundated with energy due to the sheer magical presence of this area.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EmpressButterfly","These matured Fairies are responsible for laying the Nanoprism deposits in the Hallow's underground.  Killing one would put a significant dent in the Nanoprism supply chain...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GlowingSnail","Glowing Snails are actually quite sweet and sour.  The Keeper of Knowledge himself recommends them as a tasty treat.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Gnome","Humans who lived in the Living Forest tapped into their magic there to evade the Necroavirus.  Unfortunately, such magic came with a terrible curse.  They have become extremely fearful of outsiders and cannot live in the light again.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinScout","The Goblin Warlocks long ago decreed that they were to be the enemies of Terrarians.  Their Scouts were sent to find budding Greater Terrarians and return with their whereabouts.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Slime","A scout for the Derplings.  Their gelatinous structure can harden into a bludgeoning force and is sprinkled with neurons, so it effectively serves as a simple brain for the creature. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Pinky","A rare experimental scout which was designed for having greater mobility and infiltration capabilities.  Unfortunately, it retained the instinct of hardening its membrane, meaning that it doesn't bounce. Thankfully its small size allows for effective infiltration into small spaces.  Its high density means it can drop a lot of its modified gel on defeat.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_WindyBalloon","When slimes are initially launched into an island in the Archipelago, they are attached to these balloons.  On windier days they can be carried far enough away from the invisible Derpling Outposts to reach anywhere on the island.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Dandelion","These Dayblooms have received enough pollen to advance to the next stage of their life cycle.  They may now spread highly condensed seed packets to the wind to grow more dayblooms all over the world. Unfortunately this makes them a highly dangerous pest on the Continent, and despite their alchemical properties Dayblooms are killed on sight there.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_UmbrellaSlime","This slime seems to have been impaled by a piece of trash.  Thankfully most slimes can't feel pain.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FlyingFish","A modified fish sent to collect rain.  The water of the Archipelago has excessive magical concentration, which this fish extracts into tubelike organs within its body.  These tubes collect said magic into a glowing material, allowing them to be harvested and used as glowsticks.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_AngryNimbus","An embodiment of a certain Higher Being.  No one knows what made him angry.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.DemonEye","Sometimes the Necroavirus treated the eyeballs of its hosts as separate victims, who became so bloated with infection that they permanently increased in size.  The title of Demon is not literal here.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Zombie","A victim of the Necroavirus, forever bound to roam the Archipelago as an Undead... Until you kill it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SlimedZombie","This scout has intentionally attached itself to an Undead in order to research where they go when the sun rises.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TorchZombie","A follower of the Fickle Flame in life, a mere footsoldier of the night in undeath.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ZombieRaincoat","A resourceful traveler in life, well prepared for journeying through the harsh weather. Unfortunately, resourcefulness didn't protect them from infection.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PossessedArmor"," Some weak spirit has managed to reanimate some archaic armor from a previous settlement.  The spirit exudes a similar energy to the Six... Perhaps it's related somehow?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Werewolf","During the Age of Tranquility, some Terrarians split off from the rest and began to worship Terraria's ten moons.  One of these moons inflicted a terrible curse on these Terrarians, turning them into dangerous lycanthropes.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Wraith","The spirits of darkness often manifest into terrifying shadows and hound those who dare oppose them.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CorruptBunny","A vile perversion of the Purity's symbol. It's unfortunately beyond saving, not even purification powder can save it now...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CorruptPenguin","Unfortunately, the fertility of the original bird was not lost when it succumbed to the Corruption.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CrimsonBunny","A vicious perversion of the Purity's symbol.  Is nothing sacred to the dark side of the Six?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CrimsonPenguin","The original bird's fertility has been unfortunately amplified by its Crimtane infection.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodZombie","During a lunar eclipse, pools of water share similar properties to blood.  An interesting synergy resulting from this is the fact that blood may animate into far more hostile forms during the event.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TheGroom","Many Human tourists tried to have their weddings on the Archipelago in the distant past.  Unfortunately, a certain virus had other plans.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TheBride","This dress may have been used for a wedding, but there is also a certain cult which wore them while fishing...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ZombieMerman","Mermen are a rare species to begin with, after they lost the war against the Squirrels, so it's rather tragic that one would become infected with the Necroavirus.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Clown","A particularly psychopathic Terrarian which is the terror of the Archipelago during the Lunar Eclipse.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodSquid","A servant of the Cypher's Memory.  Like their master, they are an illusion.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodEelHead","A species from a pocket dimension. The purpose of this place is unknown, but that's what the Surly Slimes are for.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CorruptGoldfish","According to all known laws of- OH GOD IT BIT ME OH GOD IT WON'T LET GO OH GOD HELLLLLLP""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CrimsonGoldfish","Vicious Goldfish: According to all known laws of- OH NOOOOO NOT AGAIN""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Drippler","Despite its appearance, neither this creature nor the Blood Zombie are actually Undead.  They're both blood clots animated by the moon's influence.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ChatteringTeethBomb","A toy of the Clown, but it's not here to play around.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EyeballFlyingFish","Oddly enough, this fish seems to have been born this way as a species, rather than any amalgamation of an eye and a fish being related. Is your lure opening the way to a pocket dimension these are native to?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinShark","A species from a pocket dimension.  Some of these pocket dimensions are oceans of blood rather than water.  How said blood isn't coagulated remains a mystery.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodNautilus","A memory of a Six long dead, hidden away in another world.  The Cipher created this record of the Spirits of Dark's archaic weapon.  For what reason it did so isn't known, but the record is titled 'Infant Dark Lord'.  When its resident dimension is opened, it creates an exact duplicate of its record.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_HoppinJack","The Derpling's decorations of this slime double as armor! It'll need it to blend in with the denizens of the graveyards.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MaggotZombie","The Maggots' innate attraction to death has lead them to hitch a ride on the nearest Undead they could find. They seem happy, in a disgusting sort of way.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Raven","A bird tasked with extracting precious Ecto Mist from graveyards.  They are highly intelligent creatures, and they often perch vigilantly during the lengthy extraction period.  They're extremely paranoid, so do be careful when approaching them...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Ghost","Tombstones are created whenever Terrarians use their innate magic to resurrect themselves.  The Ecto Mist and Ghosts are created as a special variant of ectoplasm secreted by these mysterious monoliths. The more murderous ones are a manifestation of the pain a Terrarian feels during death, and they wish to inflict as much of it on others as possible.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ToxicSludge","The sheer magical shock of the spirits of light and dark's release has caused some slimes to become far more caustic and even develop a primitive personality matrix in their system. Such slimes are a valuable asset to the Derplings and are able to relay far more advanced information to them. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GiantWormHead","These juvenile worms are far more dangerous than their previous form.  If letting them progress to this stage was a mistake, it's nothing compared to letting them grow further... thankfully most underground creatures kill them on sight.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DiggerHead","The explosion of magic from the wall of flesh's defeat has accelerated the growth of these worms and allowed them to enter their mature phase incredibly early.  Thankfully, this species has a lack of magical wards compared to other creatures.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BabySlime","While slimes do grow quite quickly, this scout has not quite matured enough for deployment yet. It's only a matter of time.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ShimmerSlime","An encounter with Shimmer has coated this scout in a reflective surface and severed its connection with the Derplings.  A truly aimless creature, it now can do nothing but wander.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MotherSlime","These slimes effectively serve as remote slime incubators for the Derplings while doubling as scouts.  Thanks to them, Derplings don't have to deploy scouts nearly as often as they used to.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CochinealBeetle","Derpling Miners have been misnamed enough by Terrarians that the name stuck.  Tasked with extracting various minerals from the Archipelago's underground, they have the ability to create hollow clones of themselves for more efficient mining.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Skeleton","Some of the very first humans to be infected were quarantined underground. Due to their longer time spent down there, their skin has long since degraded off.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Salamander2","These creatures eat the same thing as Crawdads and Giant Shellies. As a result they constantly fight for territory.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Crawdad","Due to their fierce competition with the Salamanders and Giant Shellies, only two of the three creatures can be found per island.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_UndeadMiner","Among the first to be infected were those closest to the origin point.  Those who were mining near the Dungeon were unfortunately first in line...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SkeletonArcher","The quarantine locations necessitated security guards.  Unfortunately they were quick to follow.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Nymph","A Lesser Terrarian who has gone mad from isolation.  They will attack anyone who approaches them in a bloodthirsty rage.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ArmoredSkeleton","Sometimes, the Necroavirus was able to animate corpses already deceased. These guards were part of exploration expeditions and died long before the infection began.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_RockGolem","Concentrations of magic have collected within this stone, animating it.  It's unknown whether this golem has a consciousness.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Tim","Follow only if you be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full 50 men lie strewn about its lair, so brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further!  For death awaits you all with nasty big pointy teeth.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_RuneWizard","These Undead wizards draw power from the Arcane Artery located deep within the planet.  As a result, they are rarely seen this close to the surface.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CaveBat","For whatever reason these bats are highly aggressive compared to their Continent counterparts.  They're normally extremely cowardly.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GiantBat","Giant bats are large enough to see terrarians as possible food sources, so their aggression makes sense logically as opposed to their smaller counterparts.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Jellyfish","Jellyfish tentacles often stiffen when the jellyfish dies, causing the luminous material in them to be contained and usable in glowsticks.  Unlike the jellyfish of the Continent, which attack through barbs in their tentacles, these jellyfish discharge raw electricity.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Mimic","An escaped experiment from the Dungeon designed as a security measure. Unfortunately, they attacked indiscriminately even when one had the proper credentials.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GiantShelly","Some groups of Giant Shellies, Salamanders, and Crawdads try to meet on some islands in the archipelago.  Such occasions are so rare that no terrarians have claimed to see one.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_LostGirl","Don't trust her...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GraniteGolem","The Primordial Catalyst created the granite caves in order to monitor activity within the Archipelago. Granite Golems serve as the eyes and ears of the Primordial Catalyst.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GraniteFlyer","The exact reason for the Primordial Catalyst's indigo color is not known, but it's theorized that its cause is related to when it went berserk in conjunction to the Cypher's appearance later on in the world. This would also explain why the Primordial Catalyst, a being known for favoring technology over magic, would incorporate the latter into this creature.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GreekSkeleton","Hoplites were devout followers of the Core of Life prior to their demise.  Now they walk the halls of their temple to her, both they and their surroundings eroded beyond recognition.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Medusa","How ironic, believing that ritual sacrifice would honor the embodiment of life itself.  Why would the creator of life reward those who sow death?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SporeSkeleton","The rampant fungus within this skeleton's system seems to have drastically altered its behavior.  Rather than their usual bloodthirsty self, it prioritizes propagation","Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SporeBat","This bat is unfortunately beyond saving, removing the fungus from it would kill it at this point.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_WallCreeperWall","While most spiders are imperceptible to the naked eye, some species native to the Archipelago feast on the latent magic there and grow to obscene sizes.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BlackRecluseWall","While most spiders are imperceptible to the naked eye, some species native to the Archipelago feast on the latent magic there and grow to obscene sizes.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IceSlime","In some of the more hostile areas, slimes try to camouflage themselves in order to more easily blend in with creatures that would try to attack them.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ZombieEskimo","The Necroavirus was at its strongest in cold environments. Couple that with the tundra's close proximity to the virus' origin point and you wonder why these zombies haven't already lost their flesh entirely.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IceGolem","The tundra was once a place infected by a spirit known as the Cypher. Once this spirit was utterly destroyed by the Dragons, its territory never fully thawed. It's theorized that the Ice Golem was one of this spirit's greatest champions.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Wolf","Once close to extinction at the beginning of the Age of Undead, many humans turned to dark arts at the first signs of infection and joined their ranks. For Terrarians, such a feat is impossible, but perhaps a temporary transformation is feasible?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SpikedIceSlime","A slime which has been weaponized in order to better protect itself. In islands that contain an unusually high concentration of magic, these slimes can regenerate their spikes proportionally faster, allowing them to discharge more spikes at once.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CyanBeetle","Derpling Scouts are physically weaker than other derplings in order to evade detection from some of the more intelligent denizens of the Tundra.  They are here to monitor the activity of the descendants of the Gilled Dragons, though collecting data from the occasional Terrarian doesn't hurt either.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SnowFlinx","A fluffy creature originally from the Forest which evolved in order to survive in colder climates.  Their forest counterparts were hunted to extinction, but domestication of Snow Flinx has become increasingly popular in recent years, which will likely result in a resurgence.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ArmoredViking","A leader of the Vikings. They were infected rather quickly even by viking standards, so they were buried deeper than the others.  The reawakening of many spirits has allowed them to resurface.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IcyMerman","When the squirrels won the aquatic war, many Merfolk were forced onto land. Some made the terrible mistake of trying to make their home in the Tundra.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IceBat","Studies on these creatures seem to point to a kind of frigid pathogen infecting them and turning them into living ice.  Considering what created the Tundra, it doesn't sound all that unlikely...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IceElemental","A lingering rune from a time long past, its form long forgotten.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IceTortoise","A peace offering from the derplings to the Gilled Dragons. Unfortunately, the latter was in no condition to accept such a gift.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Vulture","Scavengers of the desert surface tend to have a difficult time surviving, especially when their preference is Terrarian meat.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SandSlime","The stickiness of this slime's gelatinous form has resulted in the desert sand coating it in a fine film.  Thankfully, the slime is not harmed by this and even has better camouflage thanks to it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_LarvaeAntlion","Antlions made their home in the desert long after its initial creation. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be particularly friendly.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.AntlionCharger","The main defenders of the nest.  They are so effective at keeping their home safe that a significant amount of their ranks have dwindled in strength in recent times.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Mummy","Interestingly, the material these creatures are made of does not seem to have originated from this biome, suggesting that these hollow constructs are from elsewhere.  Said material was likely created by a nearby civilization and blown in on the desert winds.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertGhoul","These creatures were once known as the Covetous.  They're still attracted to shiny things, but it's difficult to find those in the biome they reside in.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertBeast","Scaled Dragons were once particularly greedy among the dragon tribes, so it's only natural that some fell prey to the desert's original master...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TombCrawlerHead","The creatures originally responsible for excavating the desert tunnels, Tomb Crawlers secrete a bizarre fluid which hardens sand to a quite sturdy degree.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Antlion","Antlion Chargers bring these antlions their victim's flesh ground into a sticky paste, which the latter solidify and preserve for later in pseudofossilized structures and veins within the nest. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertScorpionWall","The large amount of magical radiation which has recently surfaced has allowed this scorpion to enter the next stage of its life cycle.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.AntlionSwarmer","Antlions do not have a queen, meaning the Antlion Swarmers are the ones responsible for laying eggs and continuing the nest's life,""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DuneSplicerHead","An incredibly dangerous apex predator. These worms are at the absolute top of the desert's food chain and excrete molten mucus so hot that it's often confused for lava.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Tumbleweed","A possessed plant which has the rare properties of not being protected from strong winds by its innate wards.  It's currently unknown why exactly this is.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SandElemental","Not long after the Tundra's creation, a spirit called the Hoard was destroyed. It's infected territory, a massive mound of gold and gems, quickly experienced a structural collapse as its gold lost its luster and dissolved into sand.  This vengeful spirit is of one who was buried during the desert's creation.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Sandshark","Not related to their aquatic counterparts, it's thought that these creatures were originally statues that were given the gift of life by some higher power.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Crab","These docile creatures are constantly opening and closing their claws. Unfortunately, this coupled with their lack of self preservation often causes them to run into passerby and hurt them unintentionally.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SeaSnail","Constantly secreting a vibrant mucus, these snails are highly prized for their dyeing capabilities in squirrel, derpling, and terrarian societies alike. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Shark","Once harmless creatures, Sharks unfortunately gained a taste for Terrarian flesh after Terrarians' evolution from humans.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Squid","An evolutionary flaw prevents these creatures from properly discharging their ink when threatened, unfortunately meaning that it's impossible to extract this ink without harming them.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Snatcher","Study of these creatures was integral to learning how to conceal derpling outposts from Terrarian influence.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GiantFlyingFox","Not actually related to flying foxes, which are a creature native to the Continent. Giant Flying Foxes are closely related to bats.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Derpling","Derpling Assessors are intentionally weaker than other derplings in order to more effectively gather data from Terrarians who happen to be paying the jungle a visit. It's considered a high honor to be selected tor this occupation, and participation is voluntary. Derpling minds are modular and can detach themselves from their body to return to their database on demise, so don't feel any qualms about killing them. Their Cyan color denotes their occupation.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SpikedJungleSlime","Some slimes in the war between Derplings and Moss Hornets absorbed enough stingers that they were able to repurpose them into a natural weapon.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_LacBeetle","Derpling Cultivators are responsible for caring for the jungle plants, including extraction and cultivation of Chlorophyte, Nature's Gifts, and Life Fruit. Similarly to Derpling Miners, they are able to create hollow clones of themselves in order to perform multiple tasks at once.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DoctorBones","Unfortunately, a degree in archeology won't help you find a cure to a deadly zombie plague.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Bee","Extremely territorial, and for good reason. Honey is highly prized commodity in the Archipelago for its medicinal, alchemical, and culinary properties. Bees will fight mandible and stinger for their treasure.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BeeSmall","Extremely territorial, and for good reason. Honey is highly prized commodity in the Archipelago for its medicinal, alchemical, and culinary properties. Bees will fight mandible and stinger for their treasure.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Hornet","Unfortunately hornets will not heed the derpling's insistent demands that they stop attacking Terrarians. We apologize for the inconvenience.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MossHornet","Moss Hornet: Their extremely territorial behavior resulted in a short war between them and the Derplings. After the derplings won, they spared the lives of the remaining moss hornets due to their value to the jungle ecosystem.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Moth","A rare and mysterious sight, Moths are theorized to be some kind of emissary from the Core of Life.  They share a significant amount of DNA with derplings, suggesting they are descended from the Shelled Dragons as well.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ManEater","Study of these creatures was integral to learning how to conceal derpling outposts from Terrarian influence.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_AngryTrapper","Angry in name only, these large plants aren't capable of feeling emotion.  The name likely stemmed from their flushed coloration.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_JungleBat","A modified bat which is able to handle sunlight. Now there's no hope for you.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Piranha","These fish served as mounts for squirrel footsoldiers in the Aquatic War.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_AnglerFish","An evolutionary failure of a fish with a useless lure that does little to attract prey in the dark.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Arapaima","The Arcane Artery these fish are native to is located incredibly deep underground. It's unknown how they made it this close to the surface.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GiantTortoise","Appointed Guardians of the jungle by derplings, giant tortoises are the bane of many an incompetent adventurer.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_JungleCreeperWall","These spiders are coated in multicolored hairs which detect and map out their surroundings. As a result they are a more solitary and persistent counterpart to their nesting cousins.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MeteorHead","Elementals native to the Burning Belt, they cannot survive for long this low in the atmosphere.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DungeonSlime","The second model of slime to be created and the first to be mass produced, their key is encrypted with the proper credentials to access the secure containers within the dungeon.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.AngryBones","You would be angry too, if you accidentally wandered into a death trap and met a fate worse than death.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.BlueArmoredBones","The Marching Order was the second one to scope out this place. Their priorities were exploration rather than loot, so they didn't try to take any of the dungeon's treasures.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SkeletonSniper","A terrifying opponent with absolutely lethal firepower behind their rifle.  It's rare that they line up a shot, but once they do, it's usually already over.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TacticalSkeleton","Armed with equipment found in the nearby vicinity, this skeleton is not to be trifled with. Perhaps you could obtain some of it yourself if you defeat it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SkeletonCommando","Explosive weaponry was outlawed on the Continent long ago and a rare sight in the Archipelago to begin with.  It was probably for a reason, so I advise you prepare yourself for the worst.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.HellArmoredBones","The third and final group to try and raid the Dungeon was the Molten Legion.  Their searingly hot weaponry and tools allowed them to finally bypass security, but at a terrible cost...""CommonBestiaryFlavor.RustyArmoredBones","The first group to enter the dungeon was the Rusted Company.  Unfortunately their tradition of using rusted and degraded weapons didn't allow them to get very far.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BoneLee","Not all of the treasures the Dungeon has to offer were weaponry.  Some were body modifications and cybernetic enhancements.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Paladin","A champion, sent to destroy the Necroavirus at its source.  The Dungeon, our weapons development laboratory, was abandoned long before humans could discover it.  The irony is that the Necroavirus was meant for a threat that long predated the humans, but unfortunately once the pods containing it were breached, it reconfigured itself to attack the first non-derplings it saw.  All we could have done is desperately try to create a cure... we did, of course, but so many were lost...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DarkCaster","The magic these skeletons wield is not innate. It's siphoned from one of the many artifacts located here.  Perhaps you could siphon some as well?""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Diabolist","The fires of the underworld combined with old derpling technology forged a powerful artifact that gave its wielder unparalleled area denial abilities.  If you wish to wield this power yourself, mind the flames.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Necromancer","This magic user does not actually practice necromancy, instead using an artifact so accurate that the Higher Beings hotly debate whether it should be altered in a dimensional shift.  Their arguments about it were once heard even from the Terrarian Plane.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.RaggedCaster","Soul Energy is drawn from one's own demise. Undeath provides a small but constant amount of it, while Terrarians constantly have it radiating from them in large amounts in order to resurrect themselves.  Perhaps you could obtain this caster's artifact and use it better than they could?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CursedSkull","A dangerous security measure which has gone mostly untouched since the Dungeon's creation. It has the ability to deny access to the terrarian's storage pocket dimension and render them defenseless.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GiantCursedSkull","Giant Cursed Skulls are only released when a catastrophic security failure occurs in the Dungeon.  Thankfully, they're not quite as dangerous as the Dungeon Guardians.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DungeonGuardian","Invalid credentials.  Terminating user.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DungeonSpirit","Concentrated soul energy from a particularly ancient Undead being put to rest.  Eventually, all infected with the Necroavirus will release these spirits on death.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_LavaSlime","These slimes were adapted for the Underworld's extreme temperatures and exist to help derplings monitor the situation in the ruined demonic cities.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DemonTaxCollector","It seems like those shackles are bound to him by magical forces.  Perhaps the Dryad can help you break them?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BoneSerpentHead","Contrary to popular belief, these dragons were actually part of the Furred tribe, not the scaled one.  They quickly and directly tried to cure the Necroavirus when it first appeared, but such aggressive and blunt behavior unfortunately turned the virus against them and forced them to retreat into the underworld.  Unfortunately the blazing heat could not protect most of them from their symptoms and as a result they went extinct anyway.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FireImp","The children of demons are far more in-tune with the fires of the Underworld than the adults, meaning they can meld with the heat to disappear and reappear elsewhere and fire bolts of flame so scorchingly hot that they can melt through the ash and brick of the Underworld in order to reach an unsuspecting Terrarian.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.LavaBat","Some particularly sadistic demons witnessed some bats accidentally flying into the lava just above the Underworld and thought: what if it burned forever instead of melting?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Demon","The maniacal denizens of the Underworld were once humans who fled deep into the earth to avoid infection.  They succeeded in evading it, but unfortunately the extremely potent and unholy magic present in this area caused a host of other issues such as mutating into feral or insane conduits for magic known today as the Demons.  They come in two distinct flavors: Mindless killing machine and terrifyingly cruel warlock.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_VoodooDemon","The Guide handed some of the most fiercely covetous demons one of many keys to the Great Seal for safekeeping.  This key is an effigy of himself, the First Terrarian.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_RedDevil","Some demons have killed so many other creatures that their forms have evolved into something somehow even more cruel and depraved than before.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_WyvernHead","Feathered Dragons are the most physically unchanged of the five dragon tribes. They fled long ago into the high atmosphere when the Six Spirits revealed themselves and remained there ever since, constructing beautiful cities of cloud and sunplate.  An occasional curious one will sometimes fly to much lower altitudes in order to have some fun with Terrarians they deem strong enough.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Harpy","The servants and retainers of the Dragons were always brightly colored avian creatures, but for whatever reason those who serve the Feathered Tribe have become more and more humanoid over time.  They are often found in the lower atmosphere to protect the Feathered Dragons' territory and keep the area clear of waste.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianProbe","Even the Martians fear what lies beyond the Great Seal, so when only one layer is left they quickly must investigate any islands in the Archipelago where the seal has weakened.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Slimeling","Slimes in the corruption tend to be particularly durable and persistent, just in case they're found out to be spies by the natively corrupt creatures.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CorruptSlime","Not actually corrupted, these slimes are designed to blend into the biome in order to monitor the current state of the Corruption.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EaterofSouls","The Keeper of Knowledge's least favorite creatures.  Despite their frail and weak abilities, their swarming behaviors make them an incredibly unpopular creature among certain Higher Beings as well.  Doesn't actually eat souls, having a taste for flesh instead.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Corruptor","Long ago they were able to spread the Corruption's influence at will.  Thankfully, the Higher Beings took issue with this and shifted the dimensions to counteract this.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DevourerHead","The Corruption is actually highly disorganized compared to the other members of the Six Spirits, meaning that internal conflicts within the biome are much more common.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SeekerHead","Ebonstone is actually a densely woven writhing tapestry of wormlike creatures.  Now that this island in the archipelago has aged, some of the larger ones in this structure are finally beginning to hunger once again.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Clinger","Cursed Flames are a necessity for the metabolism of the larger corruption creatures to function, and Clingers produce this resource from their prey.  As a result, they have a more symbiotic relationship to other corruption creatures than any other, and attach themselves to the Ebonstone in order to distribute it among the dormant worms there.  If you look closely at the base of a Clinger, you can actually see this in action, as the light of Cursed Flames is bright enough to faintly illuminate the many digestive tracts connected to it.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Slimer","The corruption is beginning to seep into this slime and mutate it.  It will be decommissioned soon, but for now it's able to traverse into the more sensitive areas of the corruption unhindered.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CursedHammer","Some particularly foolish humans turned to the corruption's side during the War Against Darkness.  Their bodies were mutated beyond recognition, but their weapons were not.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BigMimicCorruption","A mimic which has consumed many corrupt souls, its form bloated and strengthened by their power.  Perhaps an artifact which contains the power of many souls could be used to summon one yourself?""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Pigron","The Gilled Dragons turned to the Six Spirits for power when the War of Light and Dark began. They retained their intelligence for the most part, but eventually sacrificed it in some obscene ritual in order to cripple the Shelled Dragons and transform them into the Derplings we know today.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertGhoulCorruption","The bright glow of the Cursed Flames stirs some instinctual need within these creatures. They consume it, even though it provides no sustenance for them.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Crimslime","These slimes simultaneously scout for the Derplings and work as small digestive organs for the Crimson, a design quirk initially proposed by a Yellow Derpling named R-52 which would allow it to completely fly under the crimson's radar as a spy.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FaceMonster","Their large orifices and sharp teeth make up the majority of their body, meaning they actually don't have any room for a stomach.  They hunt down food and take it to some of the crimson's digestive organs for metabolism there instead.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Crimera","The Crimson's first immune response manifests in these flying antibodies. Their many antennae allow them to relay information to other parts of the crimson and quickly detect their targets location.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodFeeder","These serve a similar role to Face Monsters, chewing through potential food without digesting it themselves.  Face Monsters are highly ineffective in the Crimson's bodily fluids, which is presumably why these were created.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodJelly","Blood Jellies serve as backup reserves of digestive bacteria which are released when a nearby food source is detected and swarm it.  If your skin feels particularly slimy after getting out of crimtane fluid, that means that the digestive process has already begun...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FloatyGross","The Crimson has a unique ability among the Six which allows it to infect spirits themselves. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IchorSticker","These receptacles for Ichor are highly valuable to the Crimson as they are used to weaken the magical wards of nearby terrain and allow for assimilation of it.  This is why you often see blocks turning a sickly, shiny yellow right before conversion, and can sometimes see a gold color traveling through the crimson's many veins for use elsewhere.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CrimsonAxe","Some particularly foolish humans turned to the crimson's side during the War Against Darkness.  Their bodies were assimilated into the whole or digested for sustenance, but their weapons were converted into an immune response, and could not be significantly altered in form.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodCrawlerWall","Rather than chewing up prey's flesh, these spider-like creatures directly siphon potential food's bodily fluids and process it themselves, leaving the remains for other crimson creatures to extract.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Herpling","These infected Derplings serve no greater purpose to the Crimtane whole.  A rather insulting fact, considering they were originally intended to serve as ambassadors from the Derplings in order to create a truce.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BigMimicCrimson","A mimic which has consumed many crimtane souls, its form bloated and strengthened by their power.  Perhaps an artifact which contains the power of many souls could be used to summon one yourself?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BloodMummy","The crimson has given these mummies a purpose, utilizing them for the preservation of precious nutrients and food.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertGhoulCrimson","The crimson has taken advantage of these Ghouls' instinctual lust for shiny things, turning it into a makeshift Ichor receptacle.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Lamia","A follower of a Higher Being known as the Balance Bringer, who attempts to purify any of the Six by any means necessary.   They unfortunately don't know the difference between Terrarians and the rest of the ecosystem though.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertDjinn","Lesser sand elementals angered by darkness, these spirits embody pure hatred itself.  Perhaps you could harness their power?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_RainbowSlime","These slimes are many slimes amalgamated into one, their color changing properties intensified by the Hallow's power.  They are actually quite frustrating for derpling intel as they result in several duplicate copies of data being transmitted at once. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Pixie","These larger children of the Empress are the male counterparts to fairies, meaning they do not mature into any kind of higher form more important for the hallow and instead act as its protectors.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Gastropod","A snail has made its home in this Slime and the hallow has gifted the both of them with the power of levitation.  It's unknown how they fire their lasers.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Unicorn","These are the highly aggressive primary purifiers of the hallowed lands.  They are actually responsible for the most deaths of random passerby out of any hallowed creature.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IlluminantSlime","These slimes are one of the few slimes that do not need to worry about blending in due to decent relations between the Hallow and Derplings.  Therefore, they work as a transceiver for the hallowed creatures to contact the derplings and vice versa.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ChaosElemental","A hallowed guard, originally developed by the derplings as part of their alliance.  Their teleportation abilities are highly unstable as they require frequent maintenance the hallow doesn't have time to perform. They're assigned to protect the Gelatin Crystals from outsiders.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IlluminantBat","These bats are actually highly intelligent and remember absolutely everything about everyone they encounter.  Unfortunately, this means they hold grudges against passerby for life.  They are also responsible for harvesting Gelatin Crystals, which hardens them into standard crystal shards.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EnchantedSword","Many paladins from the Continent have offered their weapons to the Hallow in order to aid it against the Spirits of Dark.  The hallow happily accepts such gifts.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BigMimicHallow","A mimic which has consumed many hallowed souls, its form bloated and strengthened by their power.  Perhaps an artifact which contains the power of many souls could be used to summon one yourself?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DesertGhoulHallow","These Ghouls are attracted to the crystal shards and grind them into a psychedelic paste which can be used as a recreational drug.  Extraction of this paste is extremely difficult.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.MushroomZombie","These zombies are more interested in spreading their fungal infection than their usual bloodthirsty rage.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_AnomuraFungus","These fungal crustaceans are filled to the brim with spores, which explode into an infectious cloud on their demise.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MushiLadybug","Interestingly, these are not actually infected Ladybugs but existed far before the Dimensional Shift that brought ladybugs into the world.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.FungiBulb","These are the primary propagators of the Mycelium.  They can burrow through many materials and as a result are uniquely suited for the job.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FungoFish","Even non-jellyfish exposed to the Mycelium's spores can become a Fungo Fish, this is one of the most horrifying transformations to witness in the Archipelago.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Lihzahrd","The Scaled Dragons were also crippled by the Gilled Dragons, though unlike the Derplings they never fulfilled the curse and as a result never recovered from it.  Their wings have long since atrophied due to the cramped quarters of their temple.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_FlyingSnake","These infant Lihzahrds are born with wings, though this is a fleeting gift.  They have yet to choose a celestial body to associate with.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinPeon","A hotly controversial talent among the Higher Beings these Goblins boast is the ability to deconstruct the wards of certain Terrarian structures. They are the only non-Terrarians known to be capable of such a thing. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinThief","In areas with high concentrations of Shadowflame, these thieves are nigh invisible.  Thankfully the Archipelago is not such a place.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinArcher","Their primitive bows have highly increased firepower depending on how much Shadowflame the wielder contains.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinWarrior","The tankiest of the goblins get their high constitution from imbuing their muscles with the shadowflame in their systems.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinSummoner","The amount of shadowflame in this goblin's system has risen to nearly fatal levels.  The agony they experience cannot be understated.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GoblinSorcerer","This goblin has risen to the upper echelon of goblin society simply by being born with an above-average amount of shadowflame.  It's strong enough that they can hurl it in orbs of pure chaos.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ShadowFlameApparition","Shadowflame is an extreme manifestation of the darkness all humanoid creatures innately have.  It granted immunity to infection, so Humans tried to harness it, resulting in their eventual transformation into the Goblins.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2SkeletonT3","These skeletons were created from dead Etherian Goblins as a sort of minion recycling front.  Unfortunately the Dark Mages cannot summon them from dead goblins directly in this dimension.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2GoblinT3","A servant of the Old One, the lowest of the low.  The Eternia Crystal serves as a bait for them as it doesn't actually contain any of the Old Ones like in Etheria.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2GoblinBomberT3","Such units are highly disposable, so trusting one this incompetent with explosives is quite low-risk.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2KoboldWalkerT3","Considering that Kobolds have a reputation in this dimension for worshiping Dragons, I wonder how they would react to the five dragon tribes? Anyways, unlike the Goblin Bombers they actually enjoy wielding their explosives.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2JavelinstT3","We are unable to find any data on what race this creature actually is.  Is it an Etherian Goblin, or something else?""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2WitherBeastT3","A support unit which is able to heal and steal defenses from nearby entities.  Fortunately, their healing capabilities are far weaker outside of their home dimension and therefore only extend to themself here.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2DrakinT3","It's theorized that these are what certain types of dragons look like in Etheria.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2OgreT3","The similarity in genetics between this humanoid and Goblins make us wonder if there's some kind of intermediary phase between them in their homeworld.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2OgreT2","The similarity in genetics between this humanoid and Goblins make us wonder if there's some kind of intermediary phase between them in their homeworld.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2KoboldFlyerT3","Unfortunately for the kobold, those wings are purely artificial and quite frail.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2WyvernT3","Unlike the misnamed wyverns of Terraria, these actually fulfill the requirements for such a classification as they have two wings and two legs.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2DarkMageT1","Another support unit crippled by the trip to this world, how unfortunate.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2DarkMageT3","Another support unit crippled by the trip to this world, how unfortunate.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2Betsy","A large wyvern with a rather poor reputation among the Higher Beings for not being much of a threat.  It's still more dangerous than any other member of the Old One's Army, however.  ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DD2LightningBugT3","The sparking magic these lightning bugs wield can stun Terrarians with a blast of dark energy, crippling their offensive abilities.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PirateDeadeye","How a pirate with one eye missing can aim at all is a mystery.  How all pirates which wield this specific model of gun lost one eye specifically is an even bigger mystery.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PirateDeckhand","Not all members of the crew are particularly adept at combat, but no one wants to be left on the ship.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PirateCrossbower","Crossbows are a Terrarian invention, exclusively wielded by them.  Not many weapons can claim as such.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PirateCorsair","Their cutlasses are primitive even by the standards of Terrarian swords... ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PirateCaptain","The true threats of the pirate invasion, looking to loot an unsuspecting Terrarian colony.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Parrot","Ironically, the reason Derplings fear parrots has nothing to do with this breed.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PirateShip","The Pirates are Terrarians which have no known landmass they call home, living their entire life on the seas or pillaging continents in the Archipelago.  Their boats can fly short distances using the innate Terrarian magic they possess.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BrainScrambler","Their apt name comes from their weapon, which can cause conflicting communication between a Greater Terrarian and their Higher Being.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_RayGunner","Their lower rank in the Martian army is denoted by their lack of protective equipment.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianEngineer","These martians are equipped with a powerful exosuit capable of  deploying nanites in order to rapidly build smaller structures. ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianOfficer","Martian forcefields are quite weak when applied to smaller targets.  They exponentially increase in strength the larger they are, which defies logic but somehow works.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GigaZapper","A rare melee attacker in the martian forces.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Scutlix","How these creatures fire lasers from their eyes is a mystery the martians are reluctant to answer.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GrayGrunt","The weakest of Martians, who only came because they were paid to. They hope to simply meet the quota of kills and collect their money in order to escape poverty.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianWalker","These tall and lanky units are highly impractical and frail structurally, but it has become tradition for them to accompany during an invasion.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianTurret","A human named Tesla was among the first to harness the power of electricity and create human technology.  Why the Martians would honor him is bizarre and unknown.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianDrone","Thankfully, these units do not have a pilot, so their explosion is not a suicidal one.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ScutlixRider","Ray Gunners which have climbed a single rank and earned the privilege of riding an unruly and dangerous animal.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Fritz","The nightmare of the curious.  A fear of those who sabotage everything.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Frankenstein","The nightmare of the organic.

A fear of the future.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.Scarecrow","This seems to be an animated form of an inanimate object, but they do not match any of our records of any similar objects with an inanimate form.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Splinterling","Cowell is the tenth moon of Terraria and has three forms.  The most common form, the black form, is invisible to the naked eye on most nights.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Poltergeist","Ghosts normally are not able to possess objects like this.  It seems that this is an exception.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Hellhound","A close cousin of the wolves, particularly thriving in autumnal environments.  That being said, autumnal environments don't actually exist on this planet...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_HeadlessHorseman","Terraria does not have any kind of seasonal variation due to an incredibly small amount of irregularity within its rotational axis.  Many creatures showing up during this night should not normally be able to exist in this world as a result.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MourningWood","Cowell's other forms, the blue and orange forms, only appear when a Greater Terrarian has forcibly attracted some of the many dimensional intersections within the moon towards themself.  In the blue form's case, this causes the surface  of the planet to freeze over with no other repercussions.  In the orange form's case, however, the intersections are drawn much, much closer to Terraria than the other form.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Pumpking","We should consider ourself lucky that the dimensional refuse from a version of Terraria with seasonal variation only shows up through arcane rituals.  Having to deal with the Pumpkings' army on a daily basis sounds appropriately nightmarish.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.ZombieElf","Santa took advantage of the infected in order to turn them into his toymaking servants.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_GingerbreadMan","A smiling cookie serves as excellent bait for would-be toys.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ElfArcher","Hot Arrows in your area.

It's thought they are distantly related to Snow Flinx.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_PresentMimic","Fortunately, not all participants in the Frost Moon are malevolent.

Too bad their teeth are sharp as ever.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Everscream","Its ornaments are filled with toxic fluids that can slowly kill plant life if you allow it to build up.  ""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_IceQueen","Those who've been naughty will soon be gone.

The true Ice Queen teleports her many minions to islands in the Archipelago where the blue form of Cowell can be sighted.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SantaNK1","By far the deadliest of the Frost Moon's soldiers.  Be on your guard against them, for they have half a dozen ways to make swiss cheese out of an unsuspecting Terrarian.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_ElfCopter","An innocent looking toy might be hiding a hail of bullets.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Flocko","She's coming...""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SlimeMasked","Surprisingly, this disguise actually seems to work against some of the less intelligent forest creatures. A valuable scout for this reason.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.CostumeDemonEye","Some particularly mischievous Terrarians like to disguise demon eyes so they can barrel right into anyone foolish to mistake them for something else.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.CostumeZombie","The ambient Ecto Mist present everywhere during the Halloween season can trick your eyes into seeing things that aren't there.""CommonBestiaryFlavor.CostumeSkeleton","I don't see anything different.  Why is this a separate entry?""CommonBestiaryFlavor.RibbonSlime","Unwrapping this scout might not be the best idea.  You might give the Derplings more data than you consented for...""CommonBestiaryFlavor.ZombieXmas","The bloodthirsty instincts of zombies make for ideal material collectors for Saint Nick.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SnowmanGangsta","The main threats of the Frost Legion.  I hope you're wearing something bulletproof.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SnowBalla","The Higher Beings have neglected to give gifts to the Frost Legion in any form for quite some time, something highly apparent in this creature's abilities.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MisterStabby","If he stabs the air enough, surely you'll lose your breathing.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_NebulaSoldier","In a lawless wasteland, sometimes all you need to survive is to perceive a few precious seconds from the future.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_NebulaBeast","An apex predator from a dying world. It's unlikely this beast will evolve further, ironically.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_NebulaHeadcrab","A planet so late in its lifespan unfortunately is bound to give birth to some unsavory species.  One that extracts brains directly from its victims is no exception.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_NebulaBrain","Intelligence and sight have become so valuable in the post-apocalypse that the Nebula Floater boasts little else.  The ability to control space probably helped too.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SolarDrakomire","A mount which flourishes under intense heat, and can even fire balls of intense heat itself.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SolarSolenian","These physically powerful warriors from the peak of Lunar society can gyrate so quickly that they can reflect most projectiles back at their caster.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SolarSpearman","Lunar society is flourishing so much that a spear made out of the sun is not only creatable but controllable.

They were so powerful that a Dimensional Shift specifically targeted them.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SolarDrakomireRider","A sign that Lunar society is at its peak.  Unfortunately, it's only down from here.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_VortexLarva","A species that became quite prevalent after the collapse of the Solar Empire.  It has yet to incubate into its stronger form, so take care of it quickly.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_VortexHornet","These vortexian insects can warp through space to ambush their prey out of nowhere.  They still have a ways to go before they're at their highest form.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_VortexSoldier","Physically weak due to the decline of their society, what was supposed to be a powerful electromancer only releases their charge on their demise.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_VortexRifleman","Times are hard in the Vortexian Settlement.  Their technology is highly advanced, but the production lines are extremely defunct and broken so they unfortunately don't have access to nearly as much of their equipment as they're supposed to.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_VortexHornetQueen","This Alien Hornet has matured to the point where it can birth multiple larvae in a matter of seconds and is too large to fit through portals. If their saliva makes contact with you, be prepared to float around for a while.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_StardustSoldier","A primitive Lunarian which has barely discovered fire.  The stars are quite bright on their homeworld, as there are both a ton of young stars and not many light sources to drown them out.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_StardustSpiderBig","A primitive spidery creature which is highly ineffective in combat.  Unfortunately such is the trend for Stardust creatures""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_StardustWormHead","Also known as a protopede, They are quite weak right now, but will evolve into something terrifying several years down the line.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_StardustCellBig","A single-celled organism which harnesses the copious energy of the stardust homeworld to undergo mitosis with no limit.  If you're not efficient at taking it out, you'll end up with more than you started.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_StardustCellSmall","A single-celled organism which harnesses the copious energy of the stardust homeworld to undergo mitosis with no limit.  If you're not efficient at taking it out, you'll end up with more than you started.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_StardustJellyfishBig","A prehistoric squid-like creature which is incredibly fertile.  It infuses its children with ambient energy and fires them at its victims.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_MartianSaucerCore","The Martians hold a petty feud with the Terrarians, the reason being that their races' name is often mispronounced.  They are native to one of Terraria's moons (Marti specifically) and as a result their name is pronounced Martee-ins. Perhaps this pronunciation will one day grow widespread enough that they will no longer hold this feud, but for now you are faced with weapons of mass destruction.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_TorchGod","The Fickle Flame himself, the most powerful of the Higher Beings.  There are many Higher Beings who have contributed to the construction of the world, but the Fickle Flame was the first and the only one that you can directly commune with using a proper ritual setup.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EyeofCthulhu","Of Cthulhu is a title given to notably colossal monsters and their servants, similarly to how the Demon title is given to somewhat large variants of small objects.

This is the first test the Derplings have thrown your way, so be proud you've completed it!""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_EaterofWorldsHead","An incredibly large worm that can only be roused by a repeated release of dark energy. These have an incredibly low metabolism and are rarely seen, as they normally lie dormant within the Ebonstone of the Corruption.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_BrainofCthulhu","The Crimson's mastermind and beating heart, or at least a hallucinatory construct of it.  It requires the many smaller hearts for assistance in oxygenating the Crimson, so destroying them is sure to get its attention.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Creeper","The eyes of the Brain. Destroy enough of these to render the Brain blind until it can expose its own personal eye as a weakpoint.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Deerclops","A particularly large bit of flotsam from a planar intersection, this large creature is notorious for being persistent to the point that it will continue to wreak havoc even after it's destroyed you.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_SkeletronHead","The Duty of the Shelled Dragons.

As the master of light, she can cast an illusion of herself halfway through the fight which allows her to flee the fight and continue it remotely.  She draws her power from the sun, and will properly reward any Terrarian skilled enough to face her at her full might.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Golem","This construct protects the Lihzahrd's stash of Solar and Lunar Tablets. The purpose of Solar Tablets is quite obvious, but the Lunar Tablet's purpose remains to be seen.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_DukeFishron","The Duke was the only Gilled Dragon to spurn the powers of the Six Spirits.   Like most other true and untainted dragons he is truly immortal and can regenerate from his mangled remains.  He is quite depressed due to every other Gilled Dragon effectively leaving him, but the sight of his favorite snack can probably get him moving again.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_Sharkron","These are the Duke's servants, shark-dragon hybrids. They are infertile and as a result the Duke must constantly recruit new ones in order to maintain his army.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CultistBoss","The Lunar Tablet was the final layer of the Great Seal.  The Cultist, a Lihzahrd, was the only one to be aware of this and conducted a ritual to try and protect the tablet from the powerful soul within. As an act of desperation, he bound this soul to his own life, and the resulting lunacy forced him to attack you.  Do not mourn him, he may have been protecting you, but you probably have bigger things to worry about now.  It's not like he won't just respawn, anyway.""Bestiary_FlavorText.npc_CultistDevote","The Ritual of Restraint takes ample concentration.

They forged it, the Dark Lord, and quickly cast it aside when they realized it was useless against the Spirits of Light.  The Spirits of Light eventually found it and repurposed it, but they could not control it.  However, they had already infused it with their light, transforming it into the Moon Lord.  It was cast aside all the same.  The Dragons who were fighting in the War, after destroying the Harmony, Hoard, and Cypher, had been crippled by the Gilled Dragons and as a result needed a weapon.  They searched through the spoils and eventually found one that would be incredibly powerful.  They resurrected the Moon Lord and augmented it with their magic and technology, granting it servants known as the Celestial Pillars.  But alas, the beast could not be controlled.  The Moon Lord became the largest threat in the entire war due to having power from every party, and as a result all three sides quickly were fighting for their lives against this new opponent.  The Dragons and Hallow formed an alliance, and created the five layers of the Great Seal to keep it and its Celestial Pillars within.  Additionally, the three remaining spirits of light and dark were sealed away, though the spirits of dark would begin to seep through the cracks.  While the Moon Lord was imprisoned, it amused itself by toying with the four pillars and forcing them to relive a constant cycle of death and rebirth on their homeworlds.  Eventually the pillars had enough, which is why they betrayed him and held him back one last time, additionally bestowing their gifts upon you.  Now that you have made it this far, you may do what you wish with your own personal island. I hope you enjoyed this journey, and I wish you the best.  See you next time!"
